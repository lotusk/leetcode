# Practice leetcode

## Goals
-  Sharpen problem-solving and coding skills

## Practice rules
- Write code only using leetcode text editor  ,no IDE, no auto complete.
- The problem will be solved using java and python.
- Using GoLang for some concurrent fit case, like 17 we could backtrace tree concurrently.
- Practice everyday.
- Optimize time complexity and space complexity as possible.
